    "text": "I don’t like the term “deconstruction” because it seems to me one of those terms that means so many different things it means nothing in particular. People use the term differently. Like conversion stories, everyone has their own deconstruction story. Some are stories of being abused by clergy. Many others are accounts of disillusionment with their church’s, denomination’s or tradition’s endorsement of the Donald Trump presidency or right-wing politics. It does seem to be primarily cognitive, referring to a cognitive process of withdrawing credence in one or more religious beliefs, doctrines, theological premises, biblical hermeneutics, or applications of these things to conservative politics. Like the evolving language surrounding the LGBTQ+ community, it might be functioning as an umbrella term to a phenomenon that has many different dimensions and manifestations. It might make sense to think of it as an identity."
